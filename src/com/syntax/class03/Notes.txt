Type casting:primitives 
 converting one data type to another;
- for example we can convert a short to a byte and long to float
two types implicit/widening/automatic and explicit/narrowing/manual
no data loss in automatic conversion
explicit manual casting
used when we use a code that was already written by someone
or merging codes within a group projects, its saving time
syntax: () if we convert a long to int: 
long var1=12355453;  int var2=(int)var1;/narrowing/manual
double var3=var2; //implicit /widening/automatic
ex float f=250.f; double d=f; /implicit
________________________________________________________

if else condition help us write code that can take the decision based on data
why we should learn: 
when we solve real life problem like testing website our programs need
to make a lot of decisions. 
example: if (the given username and password matches) {go to home page}
 else {give us warning}
syntax boolean isHungry=true; 
if (isHungry) { System.out.println("please eat smth")}
else {system.out.println("lets build java program")}
