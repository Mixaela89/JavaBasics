Type casting:
Converting the data types from one to another. We have two types of type casting. 
 - explicit/narrowing/manual   
 when we go from a bigger data type to a smaller one
 -implicit/widening/automatic 
 when we go from smaller to larger data type. 
 byte - short, char - int - long- float - double 
 byte (8 bits inside of byte means it can contain 8 ones or 8 zeros)
 short (16 bits) char (16bits) < int(32bits) <long (64 bits) < 
 float (32 bits but it contains many decimals when represented)
 double (64 bits) 
  - why we need type casting: when we work in teams we might need to convert data from different data types. 
  when we are working with math sometimes we need to get rid of decimal part as we are only intersted in the whole numberr
  - what is the syntax: Explicit/narrowing int box=1000; byte box2=(byte) box; 
  syntax for wideding short box1=250; int box2=box1;

  If statement: 
  if else conditions allow us to write programs that can take decision based on some condition and provided data 
  
  why we should lean about if else conditions - to teach program to make decisions 
  what is the syntax - if condition 
  boolean rich=true; 
  if (rich)
  {
   System.out.println("Let's buy a Jet or Island"
  }
